h1. Miranda

Miranda is a PHP framework compatible with PHP 5.3+ only, due to the required namespace support.

h2. How it works

Miranda routes all requests to the @_app/public@ directory, from there the @index.php@ loads Miranda which checks the requests URI and loads the controller.

Controllers extend the @AppController@ class, which extends the Miranda core, which auto loads the view files for the controller method.

h2. Requirements

Miranda requires:
* PHP 5.3+
* mod_rewrite (or similar)

h2. Some info

Miranda is the successor to "Avalon":http://github.com/Xocide/Avalon.
